# MSGPlugin_BungeeCord
Simple /msg and /r plugin for BungeeCord (works across different servers).

# Usage
Just drag the plugin into the "Plugins" folder of your BungeeCord server and you're done. The players can now write to each other with /msg <player> <message> and reply with /r <message> to the message they last sent, or send another message to the player they last wrote to with /msg.
